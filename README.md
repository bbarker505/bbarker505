- 👋 Hi, I’m @bbarker505. I am a Research Associate in the Oregon IPM Center at Oregon State University.
- 👀 I’m interested in using R to conduct population modeling, climate suitability modeling, and and ecological and genomic analyses.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GitHub better, and how to work with R projects to increase reproducibility in my work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my work with DDRP, a platform to conduct real-time phenology and climate suitability modeling of pests.
