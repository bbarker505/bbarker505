- 👋 Hi, I’m @bbarker505. I am a Research Associate in the Oregon IPM Center at Oregon State University.
- 👀 I’m interested in using R for ecological modeling including to investigate population dynamics, drivers of species distributions, and genomics of biological invasions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GitHub better, and how to work with R projects to increase reproducibility in my work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my work with DDRP, a platform to conduct real-time phenology and climate suitability modeling of pests.
- 📫 You can contact me at brittany.barker@oregonstate.edu.
